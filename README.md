# Hodgso24_Research_Documentation

## This repo is for documenting the different data making and analysis notebooks and scripts I used while part of Brian O'Shea's research group at MSU.

The majority of files will be jupyter notebooks, which is where I did most of my work. For redunancy sake I'll include a few of my scripts that I would submit to the slurm workload manager. All of my notebooks are designed to be able to be copied and pasted directly into a .py file, which would be run by a .sb file. I will also include a txt file or two, in case you want to recreate some of my code.

General Tips:
- This assumes that you know how to use the basics of numpy, matplotlib, and yt
- Look at notebooks for making slices and projections first, as that's where I started
- Make sure to make your axes/limits the same for all sims you're looking at so they're easier to compare to each other
