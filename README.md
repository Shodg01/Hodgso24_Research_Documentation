# Hodgso24_Research_Documentation

## This repo is for documenting the different data making and analysis notebooks and scripts I used while part of Brian O'Shea's research group at MSU.

The majority of files will be jupyter notebooks, which is where I did most of my works. For redunancy sake I'll include a few of my scripts that I would submit to the slurm workload manager. All of my notebooks are designed to be able to be copied and pasted directly into a .py file, which would be run by a .sb file.
